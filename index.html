                	Sarthak Prayas, a not for profit organisation under the societies registration act of 1860 based in New Delhi, India, began its journey in 2003 to create a backbone of the patients in the need of blood, especially Thalassemia and create mass awareness about blood donation. We also focus on Child Education for rural and urban areas, creating a platform to change their future and building a positive attitude in them. We have taken a responsibility for Sr. Citizen welfare to give them a better way of living, a space to live in their own conditions with healthiness and happiness. We havenâ€™t forgotten the danger we created to environment hence we work for environment education and awareness.
                	<br><br>
					It was not a mere hobby or an occasional exercise to run the activities on the pattern of several such existing institutions part time basis. It was a mission of creating a human chain of emergency blood donors with valid details, complete verification of the donor as well as of the needy to prevent misuse and effective management systems. We wanted to inculcate positive attitude, good human values in children and give a secure, healthy and happy environment to our elders. We also wanted to develop a sense of awareness about environment and work towards a green environment for our future generations. The whole course required volunteers to aware people and contributes their time and skills. We needed to have people with the right attitude and vision. More than anything else we required support and funds, small and big from individuals, institutions and corporate houses. 
					<br><br>
					We created this dream for Sarthak Prayas and we have never looked back to achieve our goals.

                                	Delhi is a city where people come from all parts of India and even from all over the world to get medical treatment and often require blood during their treatment. They usually donâ€™t know anybody in the city, most of the time donâ€™t have access or knowledge about internet resulting they meet the touts to get the blood.
                                	<br><br>
									Sarthak Prayas comes to help for these patients by running first of its kind Phone Blood Helpline from 8 AM to 8 PM, 365 days in the year. Patients, their care takers or the Blood Bank officials can call our helpline numbers at +91 92789 57509, 011 45650560 to register the request. They provide the details of the patients and we try to fulfil the need within 2 hours of receiving the call by connecting to the nearest Emergency Blood Donor from that hospital.
									<br><br>
									This is our dream project and we are committed to fulfill this mission.
									The idea is to create the largets human chain of EMERGENCY BLOOD DONORS who will always be ready to donate blood in any emergency. Our helpline numbers are with various hospitals in order to give timely help to the patient if they donâ€™t have stock of a particular group.
									<br><br>
									Every month we receive approximate 150 calls for all the blood groups from all over Delhi/NCR. Our dream is to create a chain of minimum 500000 such people in Delhi/NCR and in other parts of India so that nobody will die just because of shortage of blood. But, due to shortage of funds and high costing involves, facing a slow growth in the mission. Our team is continually striving to achieve this dream which will reduce untimely death significantly.

                                	We live in a superfast world where we run around to achieve our goals and set new targets, trying too hard to be in the rat race, want to achieve luxury and be happy in this monetary world. But, in this race, somewhere we have forgotten to spend time with our family, our elders having rich experience of life and ready to share with the young minds which will eventually help them to achieve success and happiness easily. Ironically, our elders are not so blessed to share the golden experience with their young ones. They are left alone at home or roads and they have no one to talk to, forced to go out and spend time in parks, outside religious places, under the flyovers. Their needs are simple yet difficult to achieve. Sarthak Prayas has taken this responsibility to give these people in their golden age a Secure and Happy environment to spend their lifetime with the same age group and likeminded people

                                	This movement was initiated in 2010 at Sarthak Prayas as there was a lot of buzz around then about pollution control and global warming, but very little work has been done. We took this initiative to create green force against Global Warming and a want to make them Ambassadors to spread awareness for Green India Clean India.
                                	<br><br>
									Sarthak Prayas is actively involved in organising awareness camps at public places and train students about the dangers of Global Warming to ensure our future generations live in a healthier and happier environment. We took this initiative of and trained 1000 school students about global warming and its negative effects and things that can be done and should be taken care of to prevent global warming. We planted 1000 saplings and made these school children Green Ambassadors and intern these children adopted these saplings and are looking after them.
